## Project status

I recently unarchived POTATO and am starting to rebuild it from scratch. It should come online a couple weeks from now (23/6/2021).

## About

POTATO was the very first major discord bot I wrote. It was added to nearly 150 servers before I gave up on the mess of code I had created.
After over a year of being inactive on this project, I have recently (beginning on 23/6/2021) started re-writing the bot from scratch. It will still use discord.js and will have the same features you loved from the old version like jokes and Minecraft integration. I will make the bot open-source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/edazpotato/potato).

For updates join my discord server [here](https://discord.gg/mzR7eeZ).
