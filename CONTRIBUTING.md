# Rules for contributors
- Indent with tabs
- Trailing commas where it makes sense (e.g. arrays)
- Use semicolons
- use the `function` for functions, use fat arrow functions (`() => {}`) for callbacks.
- Speaking of fat arrow functions, always add parentheses even if there is only one argument
- Speaking of arguments, always name them even if they don't get used (e.g. `(arg1, arg2)=>console.log(arg2)` rather than `(_, arg2)=>console.log(arg2)`)
- Don't use libraries for simple tasks that can be easily implemnted manualy
- Always use the unstable branch of everything - I want new stuff as soon as possible
- Remember to add new enviroment variables to `example.env`
- Features > Content
- Write proper types / avoid using `any`
- Test on production
- Don't write tests
- Write strings for the POTATO bot as first person from POTATO's perspective, otherwise write as first person from your perspective (don't write 'we', 'our', 'us' - it sound evil and corprate).
- Refer to POTATO as POTATO no 'the bot'
